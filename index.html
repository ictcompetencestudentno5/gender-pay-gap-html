      <h2>What is Gender Pay Gap?</h2>
      <p>
        The gender pay gap refers to the difference in average earnings between men and women. 
        In the Philippines, progress has been made toward gender equality, yet wage inequality still exists across many sectors.

        <h1>Systemic Racism & Pay Inequality</h1>
        <p id="history-sub">
            The history of gender and racial wage gaps is deeply connected to the broader history of labor in America. From the denial of wages to Black women during slavery and its aftermath, to the lasting inequalities in health, education, and opportunity faced by Native women due to land dispossession, and to the legal and cultural barriers that limited women’s ability to earn a fair income—our nation’s past reveals a long legacy of discrimination and its enduring impact.        </p>
